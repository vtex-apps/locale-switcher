## Usage

You should follow the usage instruction in the main [README](/README.md#usage).

Then, add `locale-switcher` block into your app theme, as we do in our [Header app](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-header/blob/master/store/blocks.json)

### Blocks API

When implementing this component as a block, various inner blocks may be available. The following interface lists the available blocks within `LocaleSwitcher` and describes if they are required or optional.

```json
  "locale-switcher": {
    "component": "LocaleSwitcher"
  }
```

For now this block does not have any required or optional blocks.
